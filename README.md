# DSA210 Project - Eren Emir Ayar 00032206

## Overview

### In this project, I will analyze the relationship between depression rate of population and rate of attending an art activity such as going to a theatre, concert, play or art gallery. I aim to prove that activities related to art improves well-being and mental health. I will find out which activity help the people most in terms of mental issues via statistical tools and data visualizations.

## Motivation

### **Solution for ill people:** 
### Art activites may be a solution for those who suffer from depression and that can be a treatment method.
### **Increasing respect for artists:** 
### In todays world, artists don't get their well-deserved respect. With the result of this project people will understand how they shape the society.
### **Personal curiosity:** 
### Since I am also interested in music, I wonder if it's really beneficial for human health so that I may have more information about my hobby and understand it's importance.

## Method

### I will collect the health data through WHO and TÃ¼rkiye Ministry of Health. For the participation data, I will reach out to the organisatiion companies.

### When data are collected, I will analyze them via Pandas and Numpy. Then I will illustrate them using Matplotlib. According to the results and visualizations, I hope to find a positive correlation between mental well-being and participation.
