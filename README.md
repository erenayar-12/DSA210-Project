# DSA210 Project - Eren Emir Ayar 00032206

## Overview

#### Search Question: "Do depression rate in Türkiye and attendance rate to any art activity in Türkiye are correlated?"
#### In this project, I will analyze the relationship between suicide rate of population and rate of attending an art activity such as going to a theatre, concert or opera. I aim to prove that activities related to art improves well-being and mental health. I will find out which activity help the people most in terms of mental issues via statistical tools and data visualizations.



## Motivation

#### **Solution for ill people:** 
#### Art activites may be a solution for those who suffer from depression and that can be a treatment method.

#### **Increasing respect for artists:** 

#### In todays world, artists don't get their well-deserved respect. With the result of this project people will understand how they shape the society.

#### **Personal curiosity:** 
#### Since I am also interested in music, I wonder if it's really beneficial for human health so that I may have more information about my hobby and understand it's importance.

## Method

#### I will collect the health data through WHO, Türkiye Ministry of Health and TÜİK. For the participation data, I will analyze the TÜİK data of cultural activities
#### When data are collected, I will analyze them via Pandas and Numpy. Then I will illustrate them using Matplotlib. After that, I will calculate correlation coefficients for events and mental health. I will mostly deal with means and medians, but I will also use Pearson Coefficients for hypothesis testing. According to the results and visualizations, I hope to find a positive correlation between mental well-being and participation.
